# tic-tac-toe

A tic-tac-toe player.  This is an exercise in playing with different AI game playing algorithms.  The code is mostly hacked together enough to give us a way to play with algorithms.  We are not proud of the code at all, but we've been having fun with it.

@lexun disavows all knowledge of this code, even though he was the [mob programming](http://mobprogramming.org/) driver for most of it.
